Correlate data in two files

Introduction:
  
  We have two input files which record the link between two ASNs and the router
  number of each ASN. We need to calculate the degree of each ASN which is 
  number of links that each point has in first input file. We need to filter  
  out the ASNs that included both files and output their number and degree and
  router number line by line in output file

Input files:

  links.txt: recording link and relationship of each pair of ASNs
             Relationships:0-siblings
                           1-AS1 is customer of AS2
                           2-AS1 is provider of AS2
                           3-settlement-free peers
  routers.txt: recording the router number of each ASN

Output file:

  output: recording the degree and router number of ASNs that appear in both
          input files

          including three columns:
          ASN   degrees   router-number

          totally 17592 rows
